Created by David BÃ¥ng for the course "Design Patterns for Game Development"
Description: A short first-person shooter game using the HauntedPSX render pipeline.

## Patterns
### Singletons (InputHandler.cs,  ObjectPool.cs,  LinePool.cs,  ServiceLocator.cs):
  -InputHandler.cs in "class InputHandler" as "InputHandler.Instance"
    -A single instance that is accessible anywhere, injects EarlyUpdate in which it checks and stores inputs.
    
### ObjectPools
  -ObjectPool.cs in "abstract class ObjectPool<T>" and LinePool.cs in "class LinePool<BulletLine>
  -An abstract pool which can store components in a "free list" (queue with only available objects)
  -The class is a baseclass for other pools, LinePool derives from it and stores BulletLine components.
  
### ServiceLocator
  -ServiceLocator.cs in "class ServiceLocator"
  -A singleton containing a Dictionary with services of type IService.
  -ServiceLocator is used to register non-monobehaviour objects and provide access to them to other classes.
  -Services used: EventHandler.cs,  SceneHandler.cs
 
### Component
  -PlayerController.cs in "class PlayerController"
  -PlayerController uses the component pattern to separate responsibilities into different areas. It consists of 3 derived versions of "PlayerBaseComponent": a PlayerPhysics.cs component, a PlayerWeaponHandler.cs component,  and a PlayerMouseLook.cs component.
  -PlayerPhysics is responsible for handling movement and gravity
  -PlayerWeaponHandler is responsible for handling the shooting
  -PlayerMouseLook is responsible for rotating the camera or player based on mouse movement.

### StateMachine
  -EnemyFSM.cs in "class EnemyFSM"
  -States: EnemyHostileState.cs, EnemyIdleState.cs
  -The finite-state machine is used to control logic of the enemies in the game.
  -The Enemy.cs calls update on it's instance of EnemyFSM,  which updates the current active state that it stores. Enemy.cs has no control over the inner workings of the state machine,  nor does it know what state it is currently in, it merely updates the machine and let's the states decide when to switch.
  
### Observer
  -EventHandler.cs in "class EventHandler"
  -The EventHandler is a service which provides ways to listen to and raise events.
  -This allows eg. the UIHandler to update the current displayed "Player Health" amount whenever the player heals or takes damage,  without actually needing any knowledge of the Player class
